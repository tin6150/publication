github pages publish this repo as:
https://tin6150.github.io/publication/

if there is no index.html, then github pages renders the README as landing page.
preferred for this publication site.
though the URL for doi vs cache link are rendered differently... 
seems to be a github pages-specific rendering problem, as vscode preview of the md renders fine.
